# Software Release and Progress Report

Start date:  2018-06-22
End date:  2018-10-22

## Short Summary

*[Maarten van Gompel]*

In no particular order:

* This period various improvements have been made to LaMachine.
    * added Oersetter for Fryske Akademy
    * adding Frisian-Dutch ASR (still in progress)
* Started work on the next major FoLiA version (FoLiA v2), which features a completely revised and more formal
  documentation, as well as support for provenance data (https://github.com/proycon/folia/issues/46), which should be of
  benefit to the VRE. This can be considered a head-start for CLARIAH-PLUS.
* The Frog Named Entity Recogniser is being extended gazetteers with more fine-grained categories (https://github.com/LanguageMachines/frog/issues/59)
* Discussions with Antkse (VU) on the NAF-FoLiA converter and a shared pipeline, work is slowly starting again
    * Also trying to encourage the VU to participate in LaMachine ;)
* Discussions with Dieter van Uytvanck on Single-Sign-On for Language and Speech Tools hosted at Radboud (another CLARIAH-PLUS item)
* Attended the CLARIAH Provenance Workshop and gave a presentation on software metadata
    * Discussions with Jan Odijk about high-level centralised software metadata (CMDI) and lower-level metadata (codemeta), which both have good uses and can be complementary
* There is 3rd party interest in FLAT for syntactic movement annotation, leading to implementation requests/fixes that would also be covered in our CLARIAH-PLUS proposals (https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/138)

*[Ko van der Sloot]*

* (TODO: add manually)

*[Henk van den Heuvel; RDM & Data Curation]*

* Proposals to overcome underspending 2018 and fine tuning of tasks
* Curation WGD Veluwe and Rivierenland (for e-wgd.nl)

* (Nelleke) attended and presented at the Provenance Workshop 3 Sep.
* CMDI metadata collection records for CoDoSiS, ACAD en FAME

*(Released by Maarten van Gompel on 2018-09-19)*

### LaMachine v2.4.0

> * Integrated Jupyter Labs as a web-based notebook/IDE/terminal environment (#108)
> * Included Python Course for the Humanities by @fbkarsdorp (and myself)
> * Added ``lamachine-add`` script as a way to add software, i.e. automatically edit the installation manifest #111
> * Added ``lamachine-passwd`` script to set passwords
> * Improved documentation (README), included screenshots
> * Fix in delegation to FLAT from CLAM webservices (viewer)
> * Added webserver support for macOS virtualenv flavour, but still limited (uwsgi doesn't work yet, so webservices don't work) #114
>    - **Upgrade notice**: If you come from an earlier installation you will need to set ``webserver: true`` in your LaMachine configuration for this to take effect
> * Added Stanford CoreNLP (#60)
> * Added wopr for macOS virtualenv flavour (i.e. added to homebrew now)
> * Added extra utilities for data science (extra-utils), provides: jq, ack, graphviz, gnuplot, glances, csvkit, xmlstarlet and a lot more

*(Released by Maarten van Gompel on 2018-09-06)*
https://github.com/proycon/LaMachine/releases/tag/v2.4.0

### LaMachine v2.3.0

> * Always upgrade pip, as we want to rely on the newer ``--upgrade-strategy only-when-needed`` flag, preventing unnecessary updates of dependencies if not explicitly requested.
> * An explicit ``PYTHONPATH`` is now set and used for global LaMachine installations (affects all VM and Docker installations). Users are recommended to start anew with a fresh LaMachine VM or Docker container if possible, as the regular ``lamachine-update`` will leave artefacts.
> * Fixed CentOS 7 regression problem caused by v2.2.12
> * FLAT integration completed #49
> * Implemented (limited) custom version support (#51)
>     - Custom versioning on macOS is not supported (and probably won't be supported in the future either unless there is a huge demand)
>     - Custom versioning necessarily excludes packages supplied by the linux distribution's package manager. To ensure getting a LaMachine environment close to the original, ensure you build it on the same distribution.
>     - Versioning of java/maven software is not supported yet (but will be in the future)
>     - Some software is excluded as either upstream doesn't provide the necessary release history, or it needs more effort on my part to support that release history as it deviates from the default, examples are: Nextflow, Alpino


*(Released by Maarten van Gompel on 2018-08-13)*
https://github.com/proycon/LaMachine/releases/tag/v2.3.0

### LaMachine v2.2.12

>   * Added support for pulling software from Maven Central
>   * Set a default java classpath
> * Fixed locale problems, set locale for docker and vagrant, always prevent C or POSIX locales #107
> * Added PyTorch
> * Always update pip (a proper recent pip that supports the upgrade policy parameter is needed)
> * Detect if the virtualenv python diverges from the global one, and suggest reinstallation of LaMachine in that case #105
> * Some Travis-CI fixes


*(Released by Maarten van Gompel on 2018-08-09)*
https://github.com/proycon/LaMachine/releases/tag/v2.2.12

### LaMachine v2.2.8

> Bugfix release:
> * uwsgi template somehow failed to produce a newline, causing bug #95, this should fix it
